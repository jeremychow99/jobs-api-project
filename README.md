# jobs-api-project

REST API built using Node.js with Express which allows users to manage their possible job options.

Supports user login and authentication, allows user to perform CRUD operations on their own jobs.

Created Docker image and deployed to [Heroku](https://jobs-api-project-060822.herokuapp.com/).

Since Heroku no longer has a free tier, API will likely be unavailable once my Heroku Free Dynos expire.
